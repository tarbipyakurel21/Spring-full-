Product Management System (Spring Boot)
Hey there! This is the Product project, a Spring Boot application I put together to handle product management. Think of it as the backend brains for creating, reading, updating, and deleting product info. It's a solid example of how to build a reliable RESTful service with Spring Boot.

What It Does
Here's a quick rundown of what this project can do:

It's a REST API: You can hit it with standard HTTP requests to manage products.
Full CRUD:
Create: Add brand-new products to the system.
Read: Grab details for a specific product by its ID, or pull up a list of all products.
Update: Change information for products already in the system.
Delete: Remove products you don't need anymore.
Database Ready: It's set up to work with a database â€“ by default, it'll likely use an in-memory H2 database for quick testing, but it's ready for something bigger like MySQL or PostgreSQL if you configure it.
API Docs (Optional, but Handy!): If you decide to re-enable Swagger/Springdoc, you'll get interactive documentation to explore all the API endpoints.
Tech Stack
Here are the main tools and technologies I used to build this:

Java: The core language, of course.
Spring Boot: My go-to framework for getting Spring apps up and running fast.
Spring Data JPA: Makes talking to the database super easy.
Maven: Handles all the dependencies and the build process.
H2 Database: Great for development and testing.
RESTful Web Services: Because it's all about that API life.
Swagger UI / Springdoc OpenAPI: (If you decide to throw this back in, it'll be your interactive API guide.)
Getting Started
Want to run this on your own machine? No problem! Here's how to get it going.

What You'll Need
Make sure you've got these installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+: (Check your pom.xml if you're unsure of the exact version I used.)
Apache Maven 3.x.x: You'll need this for building.
An IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code (with Spring Boot extensions) makes life a lot easier.
Setting It Up & Running
Clone the project:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/tarbipyakurel21/Spring-full-.git
cd Spring-full-/Product # Don't forget to jump into the 'Product' folder!
Build everything:

Bash

mvn clean install
Fire it up!

Bash

mvn spring-boot:run
Once it's running, you can usually find it at http://localhost:8080.

Database Details
Local Testing: By default, it's probably using an in-memory H2 database. This means all your data resets every time you restart the app, which is perfect for development.
For a Real Database: If you want to use something like MySQL or PostgreSQL, you'll need to:
Add the right database driver to your pom.xml.
Update your database connection details in src/main/resources/application.properties (things like spring.datasource.url, username, and password).
API Endpoints
Once the app is live, here are the main API endpoints you can hit:

Base URL: http://localhost:8080 (or whatever context path you've configured)

Products
GET /products
What it does: Fetches a list of all products.
Example Response: [ { "id": 1, "name": "Wireless Mouse", "price": 25.00 }, ... ]
GET /products/{id}
What it does: Gets the details for a single product using its ID.
Example Response: { "id": 1, "name": "Wireless Mouse", "price": 25.00 }
POST /products
What it does: Creates a brand-new product.
Send this (JSON): { "name": "USB-C Adapter", "price": 15.99 }
Example Response: { "id": 3, "name": "USB-C Adapter", "price": 15.99 } (The newly created product)
PUT /products/{id}
What it does: Updates an existing product's details.
Send this (JSON): { "name": "Super Fast Mouse", "price": 29.99 }
Example Response: { "id": 1, "name": "Super Fast Mouse", "price": 29.99 } (The updated product)
DELETE /products/{id}
What it does: Removes a product from the system using its ID.
Response: You'll usually get an HTTP 204 No Content.
And if you decide to bring back those handy API docs:

API Documentation (Swagger UI)
If you've got Swagger/Springdoc re-enabled, you can see all these endpoints and test them right in your browser:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html (If you're using Springfox 2.x) OR http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html (If you upgrade to Springfox 3.x or Springdoc OpenAPI).
OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs (for Springfox) or http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs (for Springdoc OpenAPI).
